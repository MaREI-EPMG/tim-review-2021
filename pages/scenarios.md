# Scenarios description

Results for five scenarios are presented - one baseline "No Mitigation" scenario and four mitigation cases, all of which meet the Programme for Government 2020 targets (reducing greenhouse-gases [GHGs] by 51% by 2030, and net-zero GHGs by 2050). The purpose of these scenarios is to inform the Climate Action Plan, 2021, (**CAP2021**), which will set forth sector-by-sector measures to achieve the Programme for Government mitigation targets.  



## Scenarios
**No Mitigation** is a "baseline" scenario, where no emissions constraints are imposed. However, no existing policies, taxes or subsidies are modelled within this scenario, so it should not be interpreted as a "Business as Usual" case. 

**Climate Action Plan 2021 (CAP2021)** scenarios outline energy system pathways consistent with four different mitigation trajectories (see Figure below). Each scenario meets the overall target of reducing total GHGs by 51% by 2030, relative to 2018, and net-zero energy system emissions by 2050. Three scenarios represent the scale of decarbonisation required from the energy sector, given different levels of abatement of agriculture emissions, which accounted for 34% of Irish GHGs in 2018, largely methane and nitrous oxide:

- **Equal Agriculture Mitigation (EAM)** – assumes that Agriculture reduces GHG emissions at the same rate as other sectors (7% per annum), requiring energy and process emissions to reduce to 19.6 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> in 2030, from around 40 Mt in 2018.

- **Low Additional Agriculture Mitigation (LAAM)** – assumes that Agriculture reduces GHG emissions at the rate of around 3.3% per annum, requiring energy and process emissions to reduce to 15 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> in 2030, a 9% average annual reduction starting in 2020.

- **No Additional Agriculture Mitigation (NAAM)** - assumes that Agriculture reduces GHG emissions at the rate of around 1% per annum, to 18 Mt CO<sub>2e</sub> in 2030 (which is the sectoral plan in the 2019 Climate Action Plan), which requires energy and process emissions to reduce to 11 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> in 2030, a 12% average annual reduction starting in 2020.

An additional scenario, the **Low Energy Demand (LED) scenario**, is included which represents the energy sector meeting the CAP2021 objectives through structural changes in energy service demands and de-materialising the economy. Broadly, this encompasses densification of settlement patterns, very significant investment in public transport and walking and cycling transport, and de-materialisation of the economy, which enables large-scale modal shifts in transport, lower heat demand in buildings and lower demands for materials such as cement. A full outline of assumptions for the LED scenario are detailed [here](low-energy-demand).

## Assumptions and constraints
There are a number of assumptions and system-wide constraints common to all scenarios:

- Emissions constraints are implemented from 2030 and linearly reduced to net-zero by 2050. The scope of the model extends to energy- and process- CO<sub>2</sub> emissions only. Following the emissions inventory methodology, international aviation and shipping emissions are not counted in the emissions constraint.
- There is a negative emissions “backstop” technology which the model can all upon to meet the emissions constraint, at €2000/tCO<sub>2</sub>, if no solution is available to it. In this set of model results, this backstop is only used in the "NAAM" scenario.
- Model results are very sensitive to assumptions on the future availability and price of bioenergy supply (both indigenous and imported). In these scenarios it is assumed that bioenergy imports are limited to biodiesel and ethanol meeting strict sustainability criteria – no import of wood is enabled. All bioenergy production met with domestic resources as assessed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland’s Bioenergy Supply in Ireland, 2015-2035, which found that the total amount of solid, liquid and gaseous bioenergy produced in Ireland could reach 138 PJ by 2035.
- Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies are constrained to start at 2030, with a 5-year lead time for construction required.
- In the transport sector, it is assumed that electric vehices reach purchase-price parity with internal combustion engines by 2025, and that bioenergy can supply no more than 20\% of existing internal combustion engine technologies, and vehicles powered by 100% biofuels are not enabled. 
- Other core assumptions and constraints are included in the [documentation](documentation).
